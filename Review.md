## Compliments:
1. The code was readale and commented thoroughy.
2. Use cases were things that are faced in everyday life of a data scientist.

## Comments:
1. For the sake of future use and reproducability of the code, I suggest adding train/validate/test_size
coefficient to the "train_val_test_func"
